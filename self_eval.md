# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
that i made it through. I'm not going to be able to finish everything, which is super bumming me out and makes me nervous for the eval tomorrow. But I'm proud that I'm still here and still learning!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
methods help manipulate data in various ways! I can imagine with super complext data that having the ability to define or call a method is super helpful!
